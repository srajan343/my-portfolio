                        We all start thinking after our boards about how we start with our college life. Every student's face is filled with excitement and trembling. But God has different plans for us. We were lucky enough to get admission in the year 2020 between the COVID
                        pandemic with the first day as online classes. Although I was very excited for my first class, I remember how every student in the class talking about opening the college but it doesnt make any difference. We open our laptop, join
                        the class, and boom, back to sleep. After spending my 3rd semester, we got the mail. In the mail it was written that the university is calling "only" second-year students with some rules and restrictions. I was happy that we had
                        no seniors nor juniors on the campus, or at least I could tell my son that I went to an offline college.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first day of my college, VIT Bhopal University, was as I expected. There was a huge competition among the boys, noo it was not for the grades or for the study stuff but it was the competition like who would make the bond with girls first. Yahh one
                        of them was me. As the days passed, I accepted that this competition was not my cup of tea. So I started putting my hands into different activities, like playing volleyball and disturbing others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One day, we got news that my campus is going to organize a fest. No standup comedians, no singers from the outside were there, and those who did not take part cant see the other events and have to boot out to the hostels. So I have decided to make my
                        team and participate in one of the events. We created a team of seven members and took part in graffiti. We make an iron man saving the earth. We all expected that we would definitely make the 1st or 2nd rank. When the result came
                        out, we were the first from the last. We all laughed, but it was fun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I made so many friends, but the only one remained was my girlfriend. Maybe I will find it someday. After our exams, we were sent back to our homes for online. Everyone protested but nothing changed. I hope I will meet my friends on the same campus and
                        then we will continue our last year's journey.
